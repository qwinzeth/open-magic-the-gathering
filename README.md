Magic the Gathering is an excellent programming target containing a stack, complex inheritance, and a naturally complex design.

To build:

./build.sh

To run:

java Matt.Stowe.MTG.Main

Most of the interactions are done with the mouse, but you can also use the following keys:

'v' - Toggle "view" mode (no visual indication yet, but if you push 'v' and click on a card, a larger version of the card appears)

(space bar) - Pass priority (make the timer skip ahead)

This version contains the following:

144 cards - Khans of Tarkir

147 cards - 2015 Core

 36 cards - Theros
