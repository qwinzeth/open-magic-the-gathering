Magic the Gathering is an excellent programming target containing a stack, complex inheritance, and a naturally complex design.

To build on Linux:

./build.sh

To build on Windows:

build.sh

To run:

java Matt.Stowe.MTG.Main

If you get a message about not being able to find the file, try telling Java that the classpath is the current directory:

java -cp . Matt.Stowe.MTG.Main

Most of the interactions are done with the mouse, but you can also use the following keys:

'v' - Toggle "view" mode (no visual indication yet, but if you push 'v' and click on a card, a larger version of the card appears)

(space bar) - Pass priority (make the timer skip ahead)

This version contains the following:

1 card - Dragons of Tarkir

144 cards - Khans of Tarkir

147 cards - 2015 Core

 36 cards - Theros
